        <h4>ABOUT MYSELF</h4>
        <p> Hi, I am Shreya. I am in 8th grade, Octaves, O2. Some of my hobbies are to cook, edit, game , sing, and listen to music. </p>
           <h2> <ol> Singing and music:</ol> </h2>
           <P>During the pandemic, I discovered my love for music and sining. I am playing guitar for over 5 months now and i love to play it. It keeps me engaged and gives me something fun to do. I also sometimes sing along while im playing guitar. While i am doing school work, I listen to music to not get bored and finish the work at the same time. I also do karaoke at my free time and sing my heart out. Its too fun to sing and listen to music. I can do anything while listening to music.</P>
            <h2> <ol>Editing and Gaming</ol></h2>
            <p>Gaming and editing is something kind of interconnected. What I like to do is, make some dance video and record it and then later edit it to make it look more catching and if I like it how it turned out, I save it. Its something I love to do excluding music and cooking. I can do it whenever i want, Like record on my laptop and edit on my phone. Interconnected. Its not like i do it for showing someone else, I do it for me as its fun for me to do and very intresting and i get to explore different kinds of effects. </p>
            <h2><ol>Cooking</ol></h2>
            <p>Cooking is like chemistry. Adding ingredients in cooking is like adding chemicals in chemistry. Cooking is like an experiment, we experiment with ingredients and if it fails, we try again. That is what we do in chemisty if they experiment fails, then we redo it till its perfect. Unlike experiments, cooking does not have to be perfect. It is special in it own way thats one of the main reasons why I love cooking so much. Even littl kids can do cooking , as cooking is not only working with fire. They can make basic things with it too like Sandwiches! Who doesnt love those? Salads! Salads are really healthy and many other fireless things. I remember when i was younger I used to go to fireless cooking classes with my sister and it was so fun!</p>
